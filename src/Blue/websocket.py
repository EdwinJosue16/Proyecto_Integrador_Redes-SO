##\brief This is the host the websocket will use to await for connections. It is localhost by default 
HOST = 'localhost'
# ~ PORT= 9002
# ~ ID_VERDE = 47

##\brief This constant determines how many bytes will be transferred over to the pipes, both when receiving and when sending
INPUT_PIPE_MESSAGE_SIZE = 256

##\brief This constant will use getcwd to find out which part leads to the folder that stores files. 
ROUTE= os.getcwd().strip("bin")+"src/Blue/"

##\brief  File descriptor for the receiving pipe.
WE_READPIPE_FD = 0

##\brief  File descriptor for the sending pipe.
RE_WRITEPIPE_FD = 0

##\brief  This constant is the message that must be sent to let blue agent know that all neighbours were succesfully received.
ALL_NEIGHBOURS_RECEIVED = "ALL"

##\brief File that will allow websocket write a log 
blueNodeLog = open("../src/Blue/Files/Logs/BlueNodeLog" + ".txt", "w+")

##\brief  String that stores the name of a file sent from the client
outgoingFileName=''

##\brief  String that stores the destination ID of the file that client wants to send
fileDestination=''

##\brief  String that stores the file name for the file that is for this node's client
incomingFileName=''

##\brief  This list saves all file chunks that are destined for this node's client 
incomingFileChunks=queue.Queue()

##\brief  This is the tag that will let know the websocket that it can start writing the file for client on disk 
entireFileReceivedTag="CKRCVD"

##\brief  This tag will let websocket know when the received bytes are a chunk of a file.
fileChunkTag="FLCHNK"

##\brief This tag identifies an ACK message
acknowledgementTag="ACKNOW"

##\brief  This list is used to store the id numbers of currently active neighbours
vecinosVivos = [0]

##\brief  This list will store messages for the client
messageQueue = queue.Queue()

##\brief  This global variable will store the most recent ACK received when a file is being transferred to another node.

##\brief  This semaphore will control access to the currentAckRn variable. It will also take care of the sender's timeouts.
senderSemaphore= threading.Semaphore()

##\brief  This semaphore will let the file receiver thread when a new file chunk has arrived. It will also take care of the receiver's timeouts.
receiverSemaphore= threading.Semaphore()

## This is the method the websocket uses to act when a message arrives from the js client.

#\brief This method is an event handler inherited from websocketServerProtocol, meant to be overriden.

# \details on Message first determines if the message from the client is binary or not. If it is, then websocket starts sending over the pipe chunks of the binary. To know how big each chunk needs to be,
#  the MAX_FRAME_SIZE constant is declared, and the upperLimit and start variables allows the websocket to know on which position a chunk starts and ends, so when a chunk is sent, both start and upperLimit
#  sums the MAX_FRAME_SIZE value to their current values. This process is over when start has a bigger or equal number than than the size of the file to be sent. When the entire file is sent, websocket also 
# sends a special message to let the websocket on the receiving end know when it has received all the chunks from the file, as well as sending a confirmation to the client. It is also worth mentioning  that each chunk 
# gets 2 tags added at the beginning of each: The chunks' destination and the chunk tag. 
# If the message from the client turns out to simply be text, then the websocket determines if it is a file name. If it is, it stores the file name in a global variable, outgoingFileName. If it is not, then it simply sends the message,
# over the pipe.  

# \param payload, message received from client. Binary, boolean to determine message qualities

# \pre This method needs the pipes values to be initialized

# \remark No variable is affected.

# \return No return value

# \exception No exception

## This is the method the websocket uses to act when a message arrives from the blue consumer.

#\brief This method is to be executed by one of the threads that start on the work method

# \details This method makes the thread to be constantly listening to the receiving pipe. Every time a bunch of bytes is received, receiveFromBlueAgent turs the bytes into a string an classifies
# which kind of message it is. If the message received has a fileChunkTag, that means that the message is a part of an incoming file for the client, in which case, the thread stores the chunk in 
# different list. If the message has a filena tag, then the message is a filename, and the string is stored in a variable to be used later. If the message. however, has a entireFileReceivedTag, then 
# it means that the websocket has received all the chunks of an incoming file, in which case it'll start writing the file on disk chunk by chunk. Once the file is assembled, websocket places a special 
# message on the messageQueue for the client that specifies the path to the file. Finally, if a message has no tag, the websocket simply places it on the messageQueue, then adds to the semaphore.

# \param No parameter required

# \pre This method needs the pipes values to be initialized, as well as the semaphore

# \remark messageQueue, incomingFileChunks, incomingFileName are all variables that may be modified.

# \return No return value
